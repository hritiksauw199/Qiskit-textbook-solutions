# Quantum States and Qubits

\
**1.2 The Atoms of Computation**

Q. If you have n bits, how many different states can they be in?

Ans. 2<sup>n</sup>

\
**1.3 Representing Qubit States**

Q. Create a state vector that will give a 1/3 probability of measuring a |0>

Ans. &radic;<span>1/3</span>  |0> + &radic;<span>2/3</span> |1>

Q. Create a different state vector that will give the same measurement probabilities.

Ans. &radic;<span>2/6</span>  |0> + &radic;<span>4/6</span> |1>

Q. Plot the vectors on Bloch Sphere

1) |0> = [0,0,1]
2) |1> = [pi,0,1]
3) &radic;<span>1/2</span>  (|0> + |1>) = [pi/2, 0, 1]
4) &radic;<span>1/2</span>  (|0> - |1>) = [pi/2, pi, 1]
5) &radic;<span>1/2</span>  (i|0> + |1>) = [pi/2, -pi/2, 1]
